# Subsamples

Program design to apply chroma subsampling in images with the aim of compress image
by adding redundancy in the manner so compressing algoritms could create better compressions from the images
once the lever of detail is reduced

## How it works

-h Show all the arguments needed for its functionality

-i, --input, image input

-o, --output, image output

-t, --type, image type, being it 420, 411, 440, 422

## Demostrantion

As it show in the image, the algoritm works by adding redundancy to the chroma subsampled but maintaining the values in the Luma subsamples
